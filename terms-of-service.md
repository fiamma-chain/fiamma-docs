2. ## Definitions

In addition to the definitions provided elsewhere in these Terms of Service, any capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings set forth below, regardless of whether they appear in singular or plural form.

* **Blockchain**: Refers to a transparent and secure technology for storing and transmitting information without a central authority. Although not legally defined, it functions as a distributed database that records the entire history of transactions between its users since inception. Because it is shared among participants without intermediaries, anyone can independently verify the validity of the chain. Blockchains can be public—open to all—or private, where access and usage are restricted to specific participants. A public blockchain can be viewed as an anonymous, tamper‑resistant public ledger. For additional information, please visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain
* **Crypto Asset**: As defined under Article 3 of the EU Regulation on Markets in Crypto‑Assets (MiCA), this term refers to a digital representation of value or rights that can be transferred and stored electronically through distributed ledger technology or similar technologies, such as ETH, Bitcoin, and comparable assets.
* **Wallet**: Means a digital storage tool that enables Users to access their crypto‑assets and to store, send, and receive such assets. When using the Services, Fiamma does not control Users’ Wallets and bears no responsibility for their operation, as Users independently own, configure, and manage their own Wallets. Examples of third‑party wallet providers include Unisat, OKX Wallet, MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet.
* **Fiamma Bridge**: Powered by BitVM2 protocol. It enables universal cross‑chain interoperability, allowing native Bitcoin liquidity to be safely unlocked and utilized across multiple blockchain ecosystems.
* **Fiamma One**:
* **FIABTC**: 1:1 pegged wrapped BTC, which is minted by a trust-minimized BTC bridge Powered by BitVM2 protocol. It enables universal cross‑chain interoperability, allowing native Bitcoin liquidity to be safely unlocked and utilized across multiple blockchain ecosystems. By verifying zero‑knowledge proofs on Bitcoin via the BitVM2 protocol to minimize trust assumptions, Fiamma BTC provides a secure and scalable pathway for integrating Bitcoin into DeFi applications.
* **Defi**: Means decentralized finance—Blockchain‑based financial services that operate in a highly automated manner with minimal or no intermediaries.
* **App**: Means a front‑end application for accessing various Protocols, hosted by the FiammaLabs Ltd., including but not limited to **Fiamma One**.
* APY: Annual Percentage Yield.
* APR: Annual Percentage Rate.

3. ## Assumption of Risk

**Blockchain Risk**

* **Standard Risks:** Blockchain technologies expose institutions to risks comparable to those present in traditional business processes, while also introducing new considerations that must be addressed by entities adopting these technologies.
* **Value Transfer Risks:** Blockchain facilitates peer‑to‑peer transfers of value without the involvement of a central intermediary. Such value may include assets, identities, or information. This model introduces new risks for the parties involved—risks that, in traditional systems, would typically be mitigated by central intermediaries.
* **Smart Contract Risks:** Smart contracts can encode complex business, financial, and legal arrangements directly on the blockchain. This may introduce risks associated with translating such arrangements from a physical framework into a digital one, particularly where one‑to‑one mappings may fail to capture real‑world nuances.

**Cybersecurity Risk.** You acknowledge and understand that we are not responsible for any hacks, unauthorized access attempts, or malicious activities targeting your Wallet, nor for any loss or destruction of your security credentials or authentication methods. You are solely responsible for safeguarding your password and may be held accountable for all transactions conducted using your password, regardless of whether you authorized them. Transactions involving Virtual Assets may be irreversible, and losses resulting from fraudulent or unauthorized transactions may not be recoverable. You bear full responsibility for protecting your security information.**Regulatory Environment Risk.** The legal and regulatory framework applicable to Virtual Assets and our Services is continually evolving. We cannot guarantee that our Services will be available at all times or that they will not experience unexpected outages or network congestion. We may rely on legal counsel regarding the application of existing or emerging regulatory requirements to our operations, and such advice may necessitate sudden changes to our Services that could affect your ability to use them. As a result, you may be unable to buy, sell, store, transfer, send, or receive Virtual Assets at your preferred times.**Personal Risk.** You are solely responsible for all activities and transactions related to your use of our Services and your Wallet. You acknowledge and accept all risks and potential consequences arising from your use of the Services and from any authorized or unauthorized access to your Wallet, to the fullest extent permitted by law.**Liquidity Risk.** Virtual Assets may have limited liquidity, which can make it difficult or impossible for you to bridge, sell, or exit a position at your desired time. Such circumstances may arise at any time, including during periods of significant price volatility.
