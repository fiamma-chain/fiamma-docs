# Overview

The traditional financial system is gated, and today’s monetary system is inherently inflationary. For billions of people, there has been little way out—until the emergence of permissionless, decentralized technologies. Blockchains sparked this shift, with **Bitcoin** leading the movement as the first and still most dominant crypto asset, now valued at over **$2 trillion**.

Yet despite its scale, most BTC remains idle. Why? Because the Bitcoin blockchain lacks programmability, and the broader on-chain experience remains fragmented, inaccessible, and unintuitive.

We are a team of cryptographers, blockchain developers, and fintech professionals pioneering **BitVM2**—the Bitcoin Virtual Machine—ushering in a new era of **trust-minimized Bitcoin infrastructure and cross-ecosystem bridges** built with **Bitcoin finality** for the first time.

We were the **first to enable Bitcoin to verify ZKPs optimistically** under BitVM2. This milestone lays the groundwork for the most trust-minimized foundation to bring BTC into broader DeFi, Web3, and real-world applications. We hold a deep conviction: **Zero-knowledge technology is the key to unlocking Bitcoin’s full potential.**

After two rounds of testnet launches for our BitVM-powered bridge, it became clear that another frontier must be tackled: **user experience**—especially when striving for both **self-custody and trust minimization**.

That’s why we will also launch **Fiamma One** soon, a non-custodial superapp delivering **one-click BTC earning**—a seamless, secure first step toward unlocking broader BTC use cases like **non-custodial lending, stablecoin and RWA strategies**, and more.

This is only the beginning. We’re building the rails for the next chapter of finance—**rooted in Bitcoin, connected to all**.
