# 3. Deposit and Stake BTC

Deposit sufficient amount of BTC (sBTC for testnet) to help process transactions. An operator is required to stake 1 BTC as a security deposit before processing transactions (the 1BTC is time-locked and still under operator's self-custody). If an operator is found acting maliciously (e.g. attempting to steal funds), the deposit will be slashed as a penalty. The deposit can be unstaked when the operator chooses to exit. Here's how to deposit and stake:

1. **Deposit Funds**

Click the **+** button next to Total Balance to deposit funds. Wait for around ten minutes for the deposit to be received. To successfully complete the staking, you need at least `stake_amount` + `dust` + `gas` BTC.

> Currently for beta testnet, `stake_amount` is 1 sBTC, so deposit at least 1.00001 sBTC to the address. Since subsequent work requires 12 sBTC, we recommend an operator to deposit at least 13.00001 sBTC initially.

Note: Fiamma Operator is running on **Bitcoin Signet** during testnet. Please deposit **sBTC** to continue.

2. **Stake Funds**

When the operator's main address has sufficient BTC, click the "Start operator" button. If you haven't staked funds before, an interface will pop up with the Stake button. Click the button to stake 1 BTC and wait for the transaction to be processed:
