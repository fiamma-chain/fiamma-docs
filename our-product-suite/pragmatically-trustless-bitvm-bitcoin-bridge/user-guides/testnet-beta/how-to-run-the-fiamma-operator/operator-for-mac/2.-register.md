**a) Sign Up**

If you're entering this referral code for the first time, the Operator app will generate three wallet addresses to process transactions.

* Main address: The address operator deposits funds to
* Deposit address: The address responsible for processing deposit transactions
* Withdraw address: The address responsible for processing withdraw transactions

Be sure to click the "Export Keys" button, and securely save your recovery phrase.
