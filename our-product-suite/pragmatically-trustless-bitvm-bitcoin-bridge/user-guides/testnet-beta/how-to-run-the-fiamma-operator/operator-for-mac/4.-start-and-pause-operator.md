# 4. Start & Pause Operator

After the staking is complete, click the "Start operator" button again to start processing transactions officially. You will be asked to enter the minimum and maximum supported transaction amount. Enter the number and click confirm, and the Operator app will start to process deposit and withdraw transactions automatically. You can see your yield in the Total Balance section.

A status bar will show up while the app is running, revealing the number ongoing transactions at the current moment. You can click the drop down arrow to see each ongoing transaction:

To pause the Operator and stop accepting new transactions, simply click the "|| Operator" button.&#x20;

* Note that the app will finish all the remaining transactions before completely pausing. Please **do not shut down the app** before all transactions are complete.
