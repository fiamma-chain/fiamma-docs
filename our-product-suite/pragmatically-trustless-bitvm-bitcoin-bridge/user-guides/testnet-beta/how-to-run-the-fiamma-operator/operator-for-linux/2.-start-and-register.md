# 2. Start and Register

### Start Operator

Run the start script to set up and start the Operator as a system service:

./start\_operator.sh

**This script will:**

* Create a systemd service for the Operator
* Configure it to run in the current directory
* Start the service and verify it's running
* Set up appropriate logs

### **Register**

1. **Get Main Address Public Key**

The main address's public key is required for registration. Here's how to obtain it:

```
cd operator_for_linux
./bcli operator -n testnet4 derive-key -s private_key_of_main_address
```

Use `public_key` to complete the registration process below.

2. **Initiate registration**

Execute the following command in the terminal to register as an operator:

```
./bcli operator register --invitation-code <INVITATION_CODE> --main-address <MAIN_ADDRESS> --pegin-address <PEGIN_ADDRESS> --pegout-address <PEGOUT_ADDRESS> --public-key <PUBLIC_KEY>
```
