# 5. Quit Operator

If an operator wants to stop receiving new tasks, the operator can execute the following command to pause receiving new pegin and pegout tasks, but will continue to finish already received tasks.

```
./bcli operator -n beta-testnet pause
```

\
To resume and start processing new tasks, execute the following command:

```
./bcli operator -n beta-testnet resume
```

\
If you want to permanently quit the operator role, execute the following command to submit a quit operator request. This process may take a while. Keep the Fiamma Operator running to complete all pending pegin and pegout tasks. Once the bridge confirms that all pending pegin and pegout tasks are completed, it will automatically broadcast the operatorâ€™s unstake transaction.

```
./bcli operator -n beta-testnet unstake -a <MAIN_ADDRESS>
```

\
When the operator's status changes to `Inactive`, you can withdraw all funds from the three addresses to an address you assign:

```
./bcli operator -n beta-testnet collect-utxos -r <RECEIVER_ADDRESS>
```
