# 1. Install and Set Up Fiamma Operator Backend Program

### **Steps overview:**

1. Set up the environment
2. Configure environment variables

### **Step 1: Set up the Environment**

Run the setup script to install all dependencies and prepare your environment:

`./setup.sh`

This script will:

* Install required packages (build-essential, gcc, g++, libssl-dev)
* Install and configure PostgreSQL
* Install Docker and Docker Compose (if not already installed)
* Install Rust and SQLx CLI
* Create a default .env file from .env\_example
* Set up database and Redis containers
* Grant **execute permissions** for scripts

### **Step 2: Configure Environment Variables**

* Prepare three BTC addresses to process transactions:
  * Main address (auth): The address operator deposits funds to
  * Pegin address: The address responsible for processing deposit transactions
  * Pegout address: The address responsible for processing withdraw transactions
* Note: Please use p2tr type addresses

\
Edit the `.env` file:

* vim .env

Enter the three private keys from your addresses:

<pre><code>BITVM_BRIDGE_OPERATOR_AUTH_SK=your_auth_private_key
<strong>BITVM_BRIDGE_OPERATOR_PEGIN_SK=your_pegin_private_key
</strong>BITVM_BRIDGE_OPERATOR_PEGOUT_SK=your_pegout_private_key
</code></pre>

* Note: Make sure you use three different addresses to avoid large UTXOs being unintentionally locked by pre-sign transactions. While funds won't be lost, this can lower capital efficiency for the operator.
