# 7. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running the Operator:

1. Verify the database and Redis are running:

```
sudo docker ps | grep postgres
sudo docker ps | grep redis
```

2. Check the `.env` file to make sure environment variables are set correctly.
3. Make sure the operator binary has **execute permissions**:

```
chmod +x fiamma-operator
```

4. Review the logs for detailed error messages:

```
tail -f .logs/bitvm-operator/bitvm-operator.$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log
```
