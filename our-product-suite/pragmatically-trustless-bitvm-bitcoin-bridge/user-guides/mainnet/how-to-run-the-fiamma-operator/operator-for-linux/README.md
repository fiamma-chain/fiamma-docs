# Operator for Linux

This comprehensive guide will help you set up and run the Fiamma Operator on Linux systems for **mainnet production**. The process involves multiple steps with advanced security features including GPG-encrypted private keys.

## Production Linux Deployment

This guide is specifically designed for **production mainnet deployment** on Linux systems. All production operators must use Linux-based infrastructure for optimal security, performance, and reliability.

## Production Environment Overview

This guide covers **mainnet production deployment** with:
- **Real Bitcoin transactions** and stakes
- **Enhanced security measures** including GPG encryption
- **24/7 operational requirements**
- **Production-grade monitoring and logging**
- **Advanced troubleshooting procedures**

## Setup Process Overview

The production setup involves these key components:

1. **[Set Up Fiamma Operator](1.-set-up-fiamma-operator.md)** - Environment preparation and installation
2. **[Start and Register](2.-start-and-register.md)** - Service configuration and operator registration
3. **[Deposit and Stake](3.-deposit-and-stake.md)** - Real Bitcoin staking for production
4. **[Query Operator Status](4.-query-operator-status.md)** - Monitoring and status management
5. **[Manage the Operator Program](5.-manage-the-operator-program.md)** - Maintenance and updates
6. **[Advanced Security Setup](6.-advanced-security-setup.md)** - GPG encryption and enhanced security
7. **[Pause and Quit](7.-pause-and-quit.md)** - Graceful shutdown procedures
8. **[Troubleshooting](8.-troubleshooting.md)** - Production issue resolution

## üîê New Security Features
