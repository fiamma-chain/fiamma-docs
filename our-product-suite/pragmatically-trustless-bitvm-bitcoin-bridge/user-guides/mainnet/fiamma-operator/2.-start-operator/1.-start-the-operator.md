# 1. Start the Operator

**Option 1: Standard Startup**

Run the start script to set up and start the Operator as a system service:

```
./start_operator.sh
```

This script will:

* Create a systemd service for the Operator
* Configure it to run in the current directory
* Start the service and verify it's running
* Set up appropriate logs

***

**Option 2: Advanced Startup (GPG-Encrypted Keys)**

For enhanced security with **GPG-encrypted keys**:

```
chmod +x ./start_operator_encrypt.sh
./start_operator_encrypt.sh
```

* Note: GPG-encrypted startup requires additional setup. See the \[[GPG encryption guide](https://github.com/fiamma-chain/operator-release/tree/main/operator_for_linux#start-with-gpg-encrypted-private-keys-via-gpg-agent-cache)] for complete instructions.
