# 3. Pause and Quit

If an operator wants to stop receiving new tasks, the operator can execute the following command to pause receiving new pegin and pegout tasks, but will continue to finish already received tasks.

```
./bcli operator -n mainnet pause
```

\
To resume and start processing new tasks, execute the following command:

```
./bcli operator -n mainnet resume
```

\
If you want to permanently quit the operator role, execute the following command to submit a quit operator request. This process may take a while. **Keep the Fiamma Operator running** to complete all pending pegin and pegout tasks. Once the bridge confirms that all pending pegin and pegout tasks are completed, it will automatically broadcast the operator’s unstake transaction.

```
./bcli operator -n mainnet unstake -a <MAIN_ADDRESS>
```

\
When the operator's status changes to `Inactive`, you can withdraw all funds from the three addresses to an address you assign:

```
./bcli operator -n mainnet collect-utxos -r <RECEIVER_ADDRESS>
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: Do not execute the `collect-utxos` command while the operator is still active. This command should only be used after the operator has been fully deactivated and all pending tasks have been completed.
