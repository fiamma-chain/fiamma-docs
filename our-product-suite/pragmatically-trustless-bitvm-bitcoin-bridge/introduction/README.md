# Introduction

## Let's Make BTC Greater Than Ever

**Fiamma Bridge** is a **trust-minimized** and **hack-resistant** Bitcoin bridge.

* **Trust-minimized**: The bridge ensures security under the assumption that **at least one member of the challenger group remains honest** (1-of-N honesty assumption). Thanks to our permissionless challenger design, N can be large and grow freely.
* **Hack-resistant**: The bridge's design makes **stealing assets significantly harder for attackers compared to conventional BTC bridges**, due to ISA (Isolated Safe Architecture).
