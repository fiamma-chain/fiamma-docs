# Challenger

Fiamma Bridge provides sustainable yield opportunities for challengers, enabling us to reduce the challenge period to just a few hours.

## **Current Reward Structure (Beta Phase)**

\
While specific reward amounts are still being finalized during our Beta testnet phase, we can outline the yield sources:

1. **Proof Verification Rewards**
   * Challengers automatically verify proofs submitted by operators.
   * If no disputes are raised, challengers receive regular rewards in tokens and a share of protocol fees.
   * _This incentive mechanism is foundational to Fiamma's security model._
2.  **Malicious Operator Challenges**

    * If a challenger successfully identifies and challenges a malicious operator, they can claim a substantial reward (up to 1 BTC, based on the current 1 BTC operator collateral).
    * With a challenge cost of only \~0.001 BTC, this represents a potential **1000X Return on Takedown (ROT)**.



## **Why This Matters**

\
By aligning incentives—through both routine verification rewards and high-value malicious actor bounties—we ensure:\
✓ Continuous network vigilance\
✓ Economically sustainable security\
✓ Industry-leading risk/reward ratios for participants

_Full reward parameters will be announced upon mainnet launch. Follow our updates for details._
