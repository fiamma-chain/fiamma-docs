# Fiamma-Committee CLI

## Installation

### From GitHub Releases

1. Visit the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/fiamma-chain/fiamma-committee-cli/releases).
2. Download the binary file for your operating system:
   * Linux x86-64: `fcli-linux-x86-64`
   * macOS Intel: `fcli-mac-intel`
   * macOS Apple Silicon (M1/M2): `fcli-mac-arm`
   * Windows: `fcli-windows.exe`
3. Rename the downloaded file:
   * On Linux and macOS, rename to `fcli`
   * On Windows, rename to `fcli.exe`
4. Move the renamed file to a directory in your PATH.

For example, on Linux or macOS:

```bash
mv fcli-linux-x86-64 fcli # or fcli-mac-intel or fcli-mac-arm   
chmod +x fcli
sudo mv fcli /usr/local/bin/
```

On Windows, move `fcli.exe` to a directory in your PATH, such as `C:\Windows\System32\`.

### Building from Source

To build the CLI from source, ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. Then follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/fiamma-chain/fiamma-committee-cli.git
cd fiamma-committee-cli
```

2. Build the project:

```
cargo build --release
```

3. After building, you can find the binary in the `target/release` directory.

## Usage

### Explanation of All Command Parameters

* `--network`: Currently only supports `testnet` network.
* `--private-key`: The signet BTC private key used to sign the tx.
* `--validator-key`: The new validator address for the fiamma chain, you can get the validator address refer to [become a validator](https://docs.fiammachain.io/our-product-suite/bitvm-powered-zkp-verification-layer/developer-guides/run-a-fiamma-node/become-a-validator).
* `--proof-id`: The proof ID for the challenge process, we provide a test proof id `1735e881fa5e58408e4710a4e8cbea0a7995f029eefdf85d7e59775b0b6c44c5`.
* `--vk-path`: The path to the verification key for the challenge process, you can obtain it from the fiamma committee cli repository [vk.bitvm](https://github.com/fiamma-chain/fiamma-committee-cli/blob/main/vk.bitvm).
* `--circuit-type`: The circuit type used for the challenge process. Currently only supports `groth16`.
* `--script-index`:The script index for the BitVM2 challenge program. This value is fixed and cannot be modified at present.
* `--reward-address`: The reward signet BTC address for the disprove process, if you challenge success, you will get the reward.
* `--txid`: The signet BTC transaction ID for the registration process.
*   `--vout`: The signet BTC output index for the registration process. you can obtain the txid and vout use the following command:

    ```bash
    curl -sSL "https://mempool.space/signet/api/address/{signet_btc_address}/utxo"
    ```

### Register as a BitVM2 Staker/Validator

To run a Fiamma node as a validator, you must first register as a BitVM2 staker using fcli. The registration process requires executing the following two commands:

**1.Start the registration process**

```
fcli register --network testnet start --validator-key <VALIDATOR_KEY> --txid <TXID> --vout <VOUT> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

after executing the above command, you will get a registration number, the committee will generate some tx and bitvm2 challenge scripts, it will take about 5 minutes.

**2.Finish the registration process**

```
fcli register --network testnet finish --validator-key <VALIDATOR_KEY> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

after executing the above command, the register tx will be broadcasted to the bitcoin network, it will take about 10 minutes for the registration to be complete depending on the bitcoin network.

after the registration is complete, you can become a validator.

### Challenge Proofs

If you want to challenge a proof , you can use the following command:

#### **1.Start the challenge process**

```
fcli challenge --network testnet start --proof-id <PROOF_ID> --vk-path <VK_PATH> --circuit-type groth16
```

#### **2.Finish the challenge process**

```
fcli challenge --network testnet finish --proof-id <PROOF_ID> --vk-path <VK_PATH> --circuit-type groth16 --txid <TXID> --vout <VOUT> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

#### **3. Monitor the challenge process**

After executing the challenge finish command, you can monitor the challenge process using:

```
fcli challenge --network testnet info --proof-id <PROOF_ID> --vk-path <VK_PATH> --circuit-type groth16
```

The console will display the challenge transaction ID, committee-generated assertion transaction ID, and challenge status. You can use the [signet explorer](https://mempool.space/signet/tx/d81eccdca492ad1c9e9b4e9dd48fb181eb566bed2949d3b8f13d28ff015e489b) to verify if the challenge and assertion transactions have been confirmed.

#### **4.Disprove the challenge**

After executing the challenge finish command, if you challenge success, you will get the reward, you can use the following command to create the disprove tx and broadcast it to the bitcoin network:

```
fcli disprove --network testnet create_disprove_tx --proof-id <PROOF_ID> --script-index 977 --reward-address <REWARD_ADDRESS> 
```

You should wait until the disprove tx is confirmed, after the disprove tx is confirmed, you will get the reward to your reward address.
