# Ecosystem Layout

Fiamma is poised to provide a cheap, timely, and secure verification service for any ZK application or scenario, laying the groundwork for mass blockchain adoption. The low barrier to entry for general nodes, coupled with sustainable and multiple rewards from various ZK use cases, is expected to attract a broader user base to the industry.

#### **New Modularity Era Based on Fiamma**

Fiamma ushers in a new era of blockchain modularity:

* **Execution Modularity**: Rollups and other layer 2 solutions continue to drive execution off-chain.
* **DA Modularity**: With various DA solutions catering to data availability needs.
* **Verification Modularity**: Fiamma takes on the verification process, allowing L1 to focus on storage and consensus.
* **L1 Simplified Consensus**: L1 nodes no longer perform computational tasks, only verifying DA and L2 state transitions, then executing consensus.

#### This modular approach offers two key advantages:

* **Cost and Security**: By offloading verification to Fiamma, the process becomes faster and less hardware-intensive, reducing costs and facilitating user access.
* **Architecture and Scenario Advantages**: While potentially trading off some security for the sake of architectural benefits, Fiamma's network security is not solely dependent on staking amounts. Our security framework is significantly enhanced by the integration of BitVM2 and the highly decentralized intersubjective nodes. These elements provide an additional layer of security, ensuring robustness and resilience across a wide range of applications. BitVM2 acts as a safety net, guaranteeing security, while the decentralized nature of the intersubjective nodes further strengthens the network’s integrity.
