# Manage Keys

## Add Keys <a href="#list-keys" id="list-keys"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
Note! Once your account is created, you must keep your mnemonic phrase safe. If you lose it, you will also lose your assets.
{% endhint %}

```bash
fiammad keys add <key-name> --keyring-backend=test
```

A fiamma address will be automatically generated such as:

```json

- address: fiammaXXX
  name: test-alice
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"XXX"}'
  type: local

```

## Recover keys  <a href="#list-keys" id="list-keys"></a>

```
fiammad keys add <key-name> --keyring-backend=test --recover
```

After executing the above command, you will be prompted to enter a mnemonic in the bip39 format

After bip39 mnemonic inputed, a fiamma address will be automatically generated such as:

```json
- address: fiammaXXX
  name: test-alice
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"XXX"}'
  type: local
```

## List Keys <a href="#list-keys" id="list-keys"></a>

You can use the command below to view the account you just created.

```bash
fiammad keys list --keyring-backend=test
```

A fiamma address named with test-alice will be automatically show such as:

```
- address: fiammaXXX
  name: test-alice
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"XXX"}'
  type: local
```

```bash
fiammad keys export <key-name> --keyring-backend=test --unarmored-hex --unsafe
```
