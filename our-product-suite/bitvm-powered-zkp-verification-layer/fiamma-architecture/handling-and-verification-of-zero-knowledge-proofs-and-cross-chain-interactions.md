## Components

* **Public Chains:** These are the major blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, where final transactions and state updates are recorded.
* **ZK Apps:** Applications that generate and aggregate Zero-Knowledge Proofs, ensuring privacy and integrity of transactions.
* **Objective Nodes:** Nodes participating in the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism to validate proofs.
* **Intersubjective Nodes :** User-operated nodes run on mobile devices involved in fetching, verifying, and submitting proofs.
* **Fiamma Chain:** The core network handling the verification of Zero-Knowledge Proofs built with Cosmos SDK.
* **DA :** Data Availability layer that stores proof-related data securely.
* **Staking:** Mechanism within the Fiamma ecosystem responsible for staking operations and state updates.
* **Finalize:** Finalization layer where transactions and state updates are recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain.

## Workflow Steps

**Step 1: Proof Submission and Aggregation**

* **ZK Apps:**
  * Submit individual proofs to the Fiamma network.
    * **Aggregate Proofs (Optional):** Aggregate proofs before submission to save costs. Note that this can increase the processing time from seconds to hours depending on the situation.

**Step 2:Objective Finality and Consensus**

* **Objective Nodes (PoS):**
  * **Begin Objective Finality:** The process to reach consensus on the submitted proofs begins.
  * **Consensus:** Nodes collaborate to validate the proof, ensuring its accuracy.
  * **Send Hash, Proof Results, and Multi-Signatures:** The validated proof, along with hash and signatures, is sent to the DA module.
* **Fiamma Chain:**
  * **Return Commitment:** The chain returns the commitment to the data.
  * **Pre-Sign Asset Transaction:** Prepares to sign the asset transaction for further processing.

**Step 3:Data Request and Proof Validation**

* **ZK Apps:**
  * **Request Merkle Proof:** Applications request the Merkle proof to construct transactions sent to the L1 chain.
  * **Access Proofs:** The requested proofs are accessed for validation.
* **Objective Nodes (PoS):**
  * **Provide Merkle Proof Request:** Nodes process the request for Merkle proofs.
  * **Access Proof Data:** Data required for proof validation is accessed and prepared.
* **Fiamma Chain:**
  * **Begin Intersubjective Finality:** The process for final validation involving intersubjective nodes **begins.**

**Step 4: Intersubjective verification and hard Finality**

* **Intersubjective Nodes (User):**
  * **Verify ZKP:** Nodes verify the Zero-Knowledge Proof.
  * **If Valid (Happy Path):** If the proof is valid, the result is marked as TRUE.
  * **Collect Intersubjective Results:** The results from various nodes are collected to confirm the proof’s validity. if the number exceeds the threshold, the proof state will be updated to hard finality.

**Step 5: Happy Path**

* **Intersubjective Nodes (User):**
  * **Send Results if TRUE:** If the proof is valid, the results are sent as TRUE.
  * **Achieve Objective and Intersubjective Finality:** Both objective and intersubjective finality are achieved, confirming the proof’s validity.
* **Public Chains:**
  * **Process Transactions (Soft Finality):** Transactions are processed if the network trusts the soft finality of the proof.
* **Fiamma Chain:**
  * **State Updates:** The chain updates its state, confirming the successful verification of proofs.

**Step 6: Unhappy Path (Orange)**

* **Intersubjective Nodes (User):**
  * **If Invalid (Unhappy Path):** If the proof is invalid, the unhappy path is triggered.
  * **Read Commitments:** Nodes read the commitments to identify discrepancies.
  * **Send Disputed Sub-Script:** A disputed sub-script is sent for further verification.
* **Fiamma Chain:**
  * **Handle Dispute:** The chain processes the dispute, verifying the invalid proof.
  * **Initiate Slashing:** Penalizes the involved parties for submitting invalid proofs.
* **Babylon Chain:**
  * **Manage Penalties and Slashing:** Manages the penalties and slashing operations for invalid proofs.
* **Bitcoin Chain:**
  * **Record Commitments and Checkpoints:** Records the necessary commitments and checkpoints for validation.
* **Public Chains:**
  * **Process Transactions (Hard Finality):** Transactions are processed if the network trusts the hard finality of the proof.

**Step 7: Finalization and Penalties**

* **Fiamma Chain:**
  * **Ensure Finalization:** Ensures that all processes are finalized, managing stakes and penalties appropriately.
* **Bitcoin Chain:**
  * **Record Timestamps and Checkpoints:** Records final timestamps and checkpoints to validate the process.

\***Additional Details:**

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Unhappy Path Handling**</mark>**:** When an invalid proof is detected (Proof\_0), it follows the "Unhappy Path," triggering the Slash mechanism and involving steps like reading commitments, issuing challenge transactions, and validating through consensus.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Happy Path Processing**</mark>**:** Valid proofs follow the "Happy Path," ensuring smooth and efficient processing without triggering penalties.
