# Key Highlights

### **Triple Security Model**

* **Bitcoin network security:** By implementing BitVM2, Fiamma pioneers in verifying ZK proofs with fraud proofs on the Bitcoin network. Our intersubjective nodes invoke optimistic ZKP verification on Bitcoin to settle disputes if any.
* **Bitcoin cryptoeconomic security:** Secured by Babylon, Fiamma chain leverages the immense cryptoeconomic security of Bitcoin network in ZKP verification in all ecosystems.
* **Decentralized and permissionless security:** Our intersubjective nodes running on mobile devices further decentralize our POS chain and help both Fiamma and Babylon identify intersubjectively attributable faults.

### **Cost-Effective and Instant ZK Verification**

Built on Cosmos SDK, Fiamma provides fast proof verification, reducing verification time from hours to seconds, and achieves \~99% cost reduction by checking signatures securely.

### **Universal Compatibility**

Designed to be blockchain-agnostic, Fiamma serves as a universal verification layer for ZK applications across various blockchain environments, including both programmable and non-programmable chains.

### **Extending the Functionality of Babylon**

Our intersubjective node module and capability of verifying ZKP on Bitcoin network by fraud proof can help Babylon offer comprehensive and secure POS services. Currently, Babylon chain can only identify objectively attributable faults like double-sign on the blockchains. With us, Babylon can better unlock the cryptoeconomic security of the 21M BTC.
